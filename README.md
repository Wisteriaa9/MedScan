# MedScan

MedScan using machine learning is a cutting-edge application designed to forecast the likelihood of an individual developing specific diseases or health conditions. The aim of this project is to predict diabetes, parkinson's and heart disease using data mining techniques and machine learning algorithms.This project implements classificiation models using scikit-learn: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier and KNN to investigate their performance on the respective disease datasets obtained from Kaggle.com.

The significance of this project lies in its potential to revolutionize healthcare in several key ways:
* Early Detection and Prevention
* Personalized Healthcare
* Improved Patient Outcomes
* Data-Driven Insights
* Empowering Individuals
